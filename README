Overview
========

nss-block is a simple and transparent ad blocking solution for systems running
glibc (http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/).

It's implemented as a dummy DNS resolver that redirects all domain names
specified under /etc/hosts.blacklist to 127.0.0.1.

Usage
=====
  1) Build and install nss-block
  2) Add "block" to /etc/nsswitch.conf, under "hosts"
  3) Create /etc/hosts.blacklist and put each domain name you wish to block in
     a separate line; wildcards are supported
